# LED-Animation-2

This creates "orbs" in a buffer and then moves them across an LED strip with blending when they overlap.
I haven't got the network functions up and running. I think it had something to do with the USB -> Pogoplug -> Virtual USB Software
setup that I had going at the time. I may return to it but as it is the animation is interesting to watch.
